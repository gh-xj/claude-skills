# 2. Five-Step Process to Get What You Want

## The Process
```
1. GOALS      → Clear, prioritized
2. PROBLEMS   → Identify, don't tolerate
3. DIAGNOSE   → Find root causes
4. DESIGN     → Create plans
5. EXECUTE    → Push through to completion
```

## Critical Rules
- Process is ITERATIVE
- Each step requires DIFFERENT thinking
- Be clearheaded + rational (higher-level thinking)
- When emotional → step back → wait until clear
- Imagine life as martial arts match

## 2.1 Have Clear Goals

### Prioritization Rules
| Rule | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| Can't have everything | Seek too many → get none |
| Reject good → find better | Don't settle |
| Don't be paralyzed | Make choice, move on |

### Goals vs Desires
- Goals = what you really need to achieve
- Desires = 1st-order consequences that block goals
- "Don't open chip bag if don't want to be couch potato"

### Mindset
- Don't mistake trappings of success for success
- Never reject goal as unattainable (before starting)
- Great expectations → great capabilities
- Flexibility + self-responsibility → unstoppable

## 2.2 Identify Problems (Don't Tolerate)

### Pain = Opportunity
- Painful problem = potential improvement screaming at you
- Bring problems to surface (even if exposes weakness)
- Admit weakness (not surrender) = first step to overcome

### Problem Diagnosis
| Do | Don't |
|-----|-------|
| Be specific | Confuse cause with problem |
| Distinguish big from small | Tolerate any badness |
| Ensure small ≠ symptom of larger | Avoid due to embarrassment |

### Example
- Problem: "I'm doing a bad job"
- Cause: "I'm not getting enough sleep"

## 2.3 Diagnose Root Causes

### Diagnosis Framework
```
Problem → Proximate Cause → Root Cause → Fix
```

### Proximate vs Root
| Type | Description | Form |
|------|-------------|------|
| Proximate | Action/inaction | Verb ("missed train because didn't check schedule") |
| Root | Deeper reason | Adjective ("missed train because forgetful") |

### Key Questions
- What happened? (facts only)
- Who was responsible?
- What type: you-problem, process-problem, or design-problem?
- Is this a pattern or one-off?

### Diagnosis Time
- Strategic thinking = diagnose (15-60 min) + design
- Speak to relevant people → analyze evidence

## 2.4 Design Plans

### Process
1. Go back before you go forward
2. Problem = outcomes from a machine
3. Higher-level thinking → look down on machine → adjust

### Visualization
- Rough plan → improve → specific tasks + timeline
- Write down → everyone sees → measure progress
- Make [who, when, what] clear

### Distinctions
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Goal | Desired outcome |
| Narrative | Story connecting tasks |
| Task | Specific action |

**Tasks connect narrative to goals**

### Common Mistake
Focus on execution, ignore planning
> "Designing precedes doing!"

## 2.5 Execute with Discipline

### Execution Rules
- Plan without execution = nowhere
- Remember connection: task ↔ goal
- If unclear → pause → ask why

### Good Habits
- Reasonably prioritized to-do list
- Clearly ticked off in order
- Clear metrics to measure progress
- Let others objectively measure/report

### If Non-Executor
Build symbiotic relationship with reliable task-doers

### Progress Speed
Goal changes > Plan changes > Task changes

## 2.6 Weaknesses Don't Matter (If You Find Solutions)

### Each Step = Different Thinking
| Step | Abilities Needed |
|------|------------------|
| Goals | Higher-level thinking, visualization, prioritization |
| Problems | Perceptive, synthesis, high standards |
| Diagnose | Logical, see possibilities, hard conversations |
| Design | Visualization, practicality |
| Execute | Self-discipline, good habits, results orientation |

### Humility = Most Important
- Look at patterns of mistakes → which step fails?
- Ask others for input → objective view
- Two paths: 1) have it yourself; 2) get from others
- Humility ≥ having strength yourself

## 2.7 Mental Maps + Open-Mindedness

### Matrix (OM = Open-Minded, MM = Mental Maps)
```
      MM→
OM↓   1   5   10
1    stuck  good  -
5    improving  -  -
10   -    -    IDEAL
```

- (1,1) → Most people stuck here = tragedy
- (10,10) → Ideal and powerful

### Question
Where would you place yourself? Ask others where they'd place you.
