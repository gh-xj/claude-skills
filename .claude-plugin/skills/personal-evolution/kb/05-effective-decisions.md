# 5. Learn How to Make Decisions Effectively

## Core Principle
Decision quality → Life quality

## Two-Phase Process
```
1. LEARNING (gather info, synthesize)
         ↓
2. DECIDING (choose what to apply)
```
**Never conflate these phases!**

## Learning Phase

### Storage Types
- Subconscious
- Rote memory
- Habits

### Quality Determinant
- Accuracy of reality model
- Requires radical open-mindedness
- Emotional blocking of opposing views = impediment

### Key Rule
> Hearing opposing views → never harmful

## Synthesis

### Definition
Converting data → accurate reality picture

### Best Practice
Triangulate with believable others

### Three Types of Synthesis

#### 1. Situation Synthesis
| Do | Don't |
|-----|-------|
| Choose info sources wisely | Believe everything heard |
| Step back for perspective | Oversqueeze single data points |
| Prefer great over new | Over-rely on recent info |

#### 2. Time Synthesis
- Collect, analyze, sort different info types
- Track both rates of change AND levels
- Use approximations (be imprecise)
- Apply 80/20 Rule → focus on vital 20%
- Be an imperfectionist

#### 3. Level Navigation
```
Above the line: Big picture, principles
─────────────────────────────────────
Below the line: Details, specifics
```
- Reality exists at different levels
- Decisions must be appropriate at level + consistent across levels

## Deciding Phase

### Definition
Choosing which knowledge to apply

### Tools
- Logic
- Reason
- Common sense

### Expected Value Calculation
```
(Reward × Probability) vs (Penalty × Probability)
```

### Critical Points
| Point | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| 2nd/3rd order consequences | Many bad decisions ignore these |
| Raising probability | Valuable at any probability level |
| Know when NOT to bet | Sometimes best decision |
| Must-dos before like-to-dos | Prioritization |
| Possibilities ≠ probabilities | Don't confuse them |

## Decision Enhancers

### Simplification
Removes irrelevant details

### Principles
Reduces decisions by ~100,000×

### Believability-Weighted Input
Not all opinions equal

### Algorithms
Computer-assisted decisions

### AI Caution
- Deep understanding required
- Future ≠ past → danger without understanding

## AI Decision Support

### Types
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Expert Systems | Specified logical criteria |
| Mimicking | Pattern application without logic |
| Data Mining | Pattern detection from datasets |

### Risk
Future ≠ past → danger without deep understanding

### Best Approach
Human + machine partnership

### Ideal Combination
Common sense + imagination + determination + technology

## Key Practices

### Before Deciding
- Am I learning or deciding right now?
- Have I gathered all needed info?
- Am I in emotional state? (if yes → wait)

### Decision Query
> "Can you point to clear facts supporting this?"

### Avoid First Trap
Don't make subconscious decision first, then cherry-pick supporting data

### Opinions vs Facts
- Opinions are cheap (everyone has them)
- Many express opinions as facts
- Distinguish carefully

### Asking Advice
- Asking uninformed people worse than no answer
- Everything looks bigger up close
- Don't overvalue new things

## Imperfectionist Rules

### 80/20 Rule
- 5-10 important factors per decision
- Deep understanding of these > marginal research
- Past certain point, diminishing returns

### Approximations
- "By-and-large" thinking
- Precise calculations often wasteful
- Most people over-calculate

## Key Formulas
| Formula | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Learning → Deciding | Two distinct phases |
| EV = R×P vs P×P | Expected value calculation |
| Principles ÷ 100,000 | Reduction in decision load |
| Human + Machine = Best | Partnership model |
| 80/20 = Focus | Vital few over trivial many |

## Final Wisdom

### Carl Jung
> "Unless you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate."

### Best Decision Maker Profile
- Rational + imaginative + determined
- Knows what they value/want
- Uses computers, algorithms, game theory
- Emotion-free processing when needed
- Pattern recognition
- Knows own limitations
