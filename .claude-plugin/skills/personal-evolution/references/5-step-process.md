# The 5-Step Process - Deep Dive

## Overview

```
Goals → Problems → Diagnosis → Design → Execution
  ↑                                         |
  └─────────── (loop & evolve) ────────────┘
```

**Rules:**
- Do steps IN ORDER, one at a time
- Don't mix steps (e.g., don't design while diagnosing)
- Nobody is good at all 5 → get help on weak steps

## Step 1: Set Clear Goals

### Diagnostic Questions
- Can you state your goal in one sentence?
- Is this a GOAL (what you need) or DESIRE (what you want that blocks goals)?
- Are you prioritizing, or trying to do everything?

### Common Failures
| Symptom | Root Cause |
|---------|------------|
| Paralyzed by options | Not prioritizing |
| Chasing shiny objects | Confusing desires with goals |
| "I can't achieve X" | Limiting belief, not reality |
| Working hard, no progress | Goal unclear or wrong |

### Fix
> "If you had to give up everything except ONE goal, which survives?"

---

## Step 2: Identify Problems (Don't Tolerate)

### Diagnostic Questions
- What problems are you ignoring right now?
- Are you confusing a CAUSE with the PROBLEM itself?
- Is this a big problem or a small one? (80/20)

### Common Failures
| Symptom | Root Cause |
|---------|------------|
| "Everything is fine" | Denial / ego protection |
| Endless firefighting | Tolerating problems too long |
| Same issues repeat | Not identifying root problems |
| Embarrassed to admit | Ego barrier |

### Fix
> "What problem, if you fixed it today, would make the biggest difference?"

---

## Step 3: Diagnose Root Causes

### Diagnostic Questions
- Is this a PROXIMATE cause (action) or ROOT cause (trait/design)?
- Is this a people problem or a design problem?
- Has this pattern happened before?

### The Key Distinction
- **Proximate**: "I missed the train because I didn't check the schedule" (verb)
- **Root**: "I missed the train because I'm forgetful" (adjective)

### Common Failures
| Symptom | Root Cause |
|---------|------------|
| Fixing symptoms | Not going deep enough |
| Blaming others | Not asking "what did I miss?" |
| Quick fixes that don't stick | Proximate vs root confusion |

### Fix
> "Ask 'why' five times until you hit character traits or system design."

---

## Step 4: Design Plans

### Diagnostic Questions
- Can you visualize this plan like a movie? Who does what, when?
- What could go wrong? Do you have contingencies?
- Is this plan written down where everyone can see it?

### Common Failures
| Symptom | Root Cause |
|---------|------------|
| Vague plans | Skipped to execution too fast |
| Plans nobody follows | Not written / not shared |
| Unrealistic timelines | Didn't account for reality |

### Fix
> "Describe your plan so specifically that someone else could execute it."

---

## Step 5: Execute

### Diagnostic Questions
- Do you have a prioritized task list?
- Are you measuring progress?
- What's blocking execution right now?

### Common Failures
| Symptom | Root Cause |
|---------|------------|
| Great plans, no action | Weak execution habits |
| Busy but not productive | Wrong priorities |
| Giving up early | No accountability / metrics |

### Fix
> "What is the ONE next action, and when will you do it?"

## Finding Your Weak Step

Most people are weak at 1-2 steps. Common patterns:

| Type | Strong At | Weak At |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Visionary | Goals, Design | Problems, Execution |
| Operator | Execution | Goals, Design |
| Analyst | Diagnosis | Execution, Goals |
| Firefighter | Problems | Diagnosis, Design |

**The solution is not to get good at everything.**
**The solution is to get help from people strong where you're weak.**
