# Decision Making - Deep Dive

## The Two-Step Process

1. **Learn** - Gather information, synthesize reality
2. **Decide** - Choose action based on what you learned

**Critical**: Don't mix these. Don't decide while still learning.

## Expected Value Thinking

Every decision is a bet:
- Probability of being right × Reward
- Probability of being wrong × Penalty

**Example:**
- 60% chance to win $100, 40% chance to lose $100
- Expected value: (0.6 × $100) - (0.4 × $100) = +$20
- This is a good bet even though you might lose.

### Key Insights

| Insight | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Raising probability from 51% to 85% is huge | Worth investing time to get more confident |
| Low probability + huge upside can be worth it | Don't dismiss long shots if downside is small |
| "It doesn't hurt to ask" | Many requests have near-zero cost, potential upside |
| Know when NOT to bet | Sometimes best decision is no decision |

## Synthesizing Reality

### Level 1: Synthesize the Situation
- Separate big from small
- Don't treat all information equally
- Ask: "What are the 5-10 things that really matter here?"

### Level 2: Synthesize Over Time
- Look at rate of change, not just current state
- A score improving from 40→55 is different from 80→85
- Is the trend taking you where you need to go?

### Level 3: Navigate Levels
- Zoom out: What's the big picture?
- Zoom in: What are the critical details?
- Connect: How do details serve the big picture?

## Common Decision Traps

| Trap | Description | Fix |
|------|-------------|-----|
| First-order thinking | Only seeing immediate consequences | Ask "and then what?" 2-3 times |
| Confirmation bias | Seeking info that confirms your view | Actively seek disconfirming evidence |
| Overweighting recent | What just happened feels most important | Zoom out to longer timeframes |
| Precision over accuracy | Getting exact numbers for wrong things | "Roughly right" beats "precisely wrong" |
| Analysis paralysis | Can't decide without perfect info | Use 80/20 - good enough is good enough |

## The Believability Matrix

When making important decisions:

```
           High Believability
                  │
                  │ ← Ask these people
                  │
Low Logic ────────┼──────── High Logic
                  │
                  │ ← Ignore these
                  │
           Low Believability
```

**Best sources**: High believability + High logic (can explain why)

## Principles as Decision Tools

When facing a decision:

1. **Recognize the type** - "This is a 'similar situation' I've seen before"
2. **Find the principle** - What rule applies here?
3. **Apply it** - Use the principle to guide action
4. **Refine it** - After results, was the principle right?

> "Almost all 'cases at hand' are just 'another one of those'"

## The Machine View for Decisions

Step outside yourself:

1. **You as designer**: What's the optimal outcome?
2. **You as worker**: Can you execute this?
3. **Gap analysis**: If worker-you can't, who can?

This removes ego from the equation.

## When to Decide vs. Wait

| Decide Now | Wait for More Info |
|------------|-------------------|
| Cost of delay is high | Cost of being wrong is high |
| Info won't improve much | More info is available |
| Decision is reversible | Decision is irreversible |
| You have enough to act | Critical unknowns remain |

**Default**: Err toward action for reversible decisions, patience for irreversible ones.

## AI + Human Decision Making

Best results come from combining:

| Human Strength | AI/System Strength |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Creativity, imagination | Processing speed |
| Novel situations | Pattern matching on data |
| Values, meaning | Consistency, no fatigue |
| Intuition from experience | No emotional bias |

> "The best decision-makers know what they're good at, what computers are good at, and how to combine them."
