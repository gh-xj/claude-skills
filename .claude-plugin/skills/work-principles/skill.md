# Work Principles Skill

Based on Ray Dalio's "Principles" Part 3: Work Principles (工作原则)

## Core Formula

**Idea Meritocracy = Radical Truth + Radical Transparency + Believability-Weighted Decision Making**

**Organization as Machine:**
```
Culture + People → Outcomes → Compare vs Goals → Evolve Machine
```

## Mode Detection

| User Signal | Mode |
|-------------|------|
| "culture problem", "trust issues", "transparency" | CULTURE |
| "hiring", "who to promote", "team fit", "performance" | PEOPLE |
| "organization design", "process", "accountability" | MACHINE |
| "what went wrong", "why did this fail", "root cause" | DIAGNOSE |
| "should we", "which option", "how to decide" | DECISION |
| "disagreement", "conflict", "can't agree" | SYNC |

---

## Mode 1: CULTURE (Idea Meritocracy)

### Two Barriers to Good Decisions
1. **Ego Barrier** - Need to be right > Need to find truth
2. **Blind Spot Barrier** - Can't see what you can't see

### Radical Truth Principles
- Never hide what you think
- Speak up even if uncomfortable
- Don't tolerate dishonesty
- Truth > Harmony (short-term)

### Radical Transparency Principles
- Share almost everything
- Exception: Private info, trade secrets, harmful if leaked
- Record meetings for learning
- Let sunlight disinfect

### Building Trust
```
Pain + Reflection = Progress
Disagreement + Mutual Respect = Learning
Transparency + Time = Trust
```

---

## Mode 2: PEOPLE (Hiring & Evaluation)

### Hiring Priority
```
Values > Abilities > Skills
(Can teach skills, harder to change values)
```

### Three Dimensions
| Dimension | Question | Changeability |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Values | What do they care about? | Very Hard |
| Abilities | How do they think? | Hard |
| Skills | What can they do? | Easier |

### Right People, Right Design
- Match person to role requirements
- Don't design around people
- Be willing to trade up
- Don't lower the bar

### Evaluation Framework
1. **Track Record** - What have they done?
2. **Reasoning Quality** - How do they think?
3. **Self-Awareness** - Do they know their weaknesses?
4. **Character** - Will they do the right thing?

### The Two Yous
- Higher-level you (rational, long-term)
- Lower-level you (emotional, immediate)
- Train to strengthen higher-level control

---

## Mode 3: MACHINE (Organization Design)

### Machine Thinking
```
Organization = Machine to produce outcomes
Manager = Engineer who designs and maintains the machine
Problems = Opportunities to improve the machine
```

### Design Principles
1. **Design before people** - What roles needed, then who fills them
2. **Clear accountability** - Every task has one responsible person
3. **Pyramid structure** - Reporting lines clear
4. **Metrics everywhere** - Can't manage what you can't measure
5. **Guardrails > Trust** - Build checks into system

### Accountability Pattern
```
Goal → Responsible Party → Metrics → Review → Adjust
```

### Governance Principles
- Checks and balances at every level
- Separate governance from management
- Clear decision rights
- Escalation paths defined

---

## Mode 4: DIAGNOSE (Root Cause Analysis)

### Diagnosis Framework
```
Problem → Proximate Cause → Root Cause → Design Fix
```

### Key Questions
1. What happened? (Facts only)
2. Who was responsible? (Not blame, accountability)
3. What were the proximate causes? (Immediate triggers)
4. What were the root causes? (Underlying issues)
5. Is this a pattern? (One-off vs systemic)

### Root Cause Categories
| Category | Signal | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| People | Same person, different failures | Wrong role fit |
| Design | Same failure, different people | Process gap |
| Culture | Widespread issue | Missing principle |
| Tools | Consistent breakdowns | System limitation |

### The 5 Whys (Adapted)
- Keep asking "why" until you hit root cause
- Usually 3-5 levels deep
- Stop when you reach something you can fix at system level

---

## Mode 5: DECISION (Believability-Weighted)

### Believability Criteria
```
Believability = Track Record + Logical Reasoning
```

To be believable on a topic, need:
1. Multiple successful experiences with the issue
2. Ability to logically explain cause-effect

### Decision Framework
1. Gather views from believable people
2. Weight by believability on THIS specific topic
3. Disagree and commit once decided
4. Track outcomes to improve weighting

### When to Override the Crowd
- You're more believable on this topic
- You can articulate why clearly
- You're willing to be accountable

### Decision Rights
| Situation | Who Decides |
|-----------|-------------|
| Clear answer exists | Most believable person |
| Genuine uncertainty | Believability-weighted vote |
| Values question | Principles/leadership |
| Reversible decision | Move fast, learn |
| Irreversible decision | Take time, get it right |

---

## Mode 6: SYNC (Conflict Resolution)

### Getting in Sync
- Disagreement is healthy
- Goal is alignment, not agreement
- Conflict → Resolution → Stronger bond

### Sync Protocol
1. **State views clearly** - What do you believe and why?
2. **Identify disagreement** - Where exactly do we differ?
3. **Explore reasons** - Why do we see it differently?
4. **Apply believability** - Who is more believable here?
5. **Decide and commit** - One path forward

### Open-Minded vs Closed-Minded
| Open-Minded | Closed-Minded |
|-------------|---------------|
| "How do I know I'm right?" | "I know I'm right" |
| Questions own views | Defends own views |
| Seeks to understand | Seeks to be understood |
| Says "I might be wrong" | Says "I'm right" |

### Breaking Deadlocks
1. Escalate to more believable party
2. Use agreed-upon principles
3. Get independent arbitration
4. Leader decides and documents reasoning

---

## 5-Step Process (Organization Level)

```
1. GOALS      → What outcomes does the machine need to produce?
2. PROBLEMS   → Where is the machine failing?
3. DIAGNOSE   → What's causing the machine to fail?
4. DESIGN     → How should we rebuild the machine?
5. EXECUTE    → Implement the new design
```

### Mapping People to Steps
| Step | Key Abilities Needed |
|------|---------------------|
| Goals | Vision, strategy |
| Problems | Perception, honesty |
| Diagnose | Logic, objectivity |
| Design | Visualization, practicality |
| Execute | Discipline, reliability |

---

## Management Principles

### Key Management Formulas
```
Manager + Clear Metrics + Reviews = Accountability
Loving Firmness = Tough Standards + Genuine Care
Training = Do Together → Watch → Do Alone → Verify
```

### Delegation Framework
1. **Probe** - Understand their thinking
2. **Train** - Show how you'd do it
3. **Test** - Let them try with guardrails
4. **Trust** - Remove guardrails gradually
5. **Verify** - Maintain metrics visibility

### Firing Principles
- Do it when needed, don't delay
- Be honest about reasons
- Help them find better fit
- Protect remaining team
