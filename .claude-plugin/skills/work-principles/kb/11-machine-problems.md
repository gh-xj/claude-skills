# 11. Perceive and Don't Tolerate Problems

## Core Principle
```
If you're not worried, you need to worry
Problems surfaced > Problems hidden
```

## Why Problems Stay Hidden

### Human Nature
- Fear of blame
- Desire to look good
- Hope it will resolve itself
- Avoid conflict

### Organizational Pressure
- Shoot the messenger culture
- Punish for problems, not hiding
- No safe reporting channel

## Perceiver Assignment

### Dedicated Perceivers
- Assign people specifically to find problems
- Different from people doing the work
- Fresh eyes see more

### "Taste the Soup"
- Sample outputs regularly
- Random checks
- Customer feedback loops
- Quality audits

### Many Eyes Principle
```
More perceivers → More problems found → Better outcomes
```

## Warning Signs

### Frog in Boiling Water
- Gradual degradation unnoticed
- Compare to baseline, not yesterday
- External benchmarking
- Historical trend analysis

### Early Indicators
| Sign | Possible Problem |
|------|------------------|
| Declining metrics | Process breakdown |
| Increased complaints | Quality issue |
| Staff turnover | Culture problem |
| Missed deadlines | Capacity/capability gap |

## Creating Problem-Surfacing Culture

### Make It Safe
- Reward problem finding
- Punish problem hiding
- Celebrate fixes, not just successes
- Leaders model vulnerability

### Issue Log (Mandatory)
```
Problem occurs → Log it → Assign owner → Track resolution
```

### Rules
| Rule | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Log it = safe | Encourage honesty |
| Don't log = trouble | Accountability |
| Any severity logged | Complete picture |
| Who responsible = clear | Ownership |

## Intolerance of Problems

### What Intolerance Means
- Don't let problems slide
- Don't normalize dysfunction
- Don't accept "that's how it is"
- Don't lower standards

### Fierce Intolerance
> "Develop fierce intolerance of badness of any kind, regardless of severity"

### Prioritization
```
Not all problems equal
Focus on: Impact × Frequency × Root cause depth
```

## Key Formulas
| Formula | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Not worried → Worry | Complacency danger |
| Many eyes = More found | Perceiver quantity |
| Log it = Safe | Issue log principle |
| Intolerance = Standard | Don't normalize problems |
