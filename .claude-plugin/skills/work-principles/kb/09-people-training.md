# 9. Constantly Train, Test, Evaluate, and Sort People

## Core Principle
```
Personal evolution should be rapid and natural
Constant feedback = Kindness
```

## Training Philosophy

### Training Loop
```
Do Together → Watch Them → They Do Alone → Verify → Adjust
```

### Training vs Hoping
| Training | Hoping |
|----------|--------|
| Explicit instruction | Assume they know |
| Practice with feedback | Wait for results |
| Gradual autonomy | Full autonomy immediately |
| Verify understanding | Assume understanding |

## Constant Feedback

### Why Constant
- Small corrections > big corrections
- Real-time learning
- Prevents drift
- Shows you care

### Accuracy = Kindness
- Honest feedback helps growth
- Sugarcoating hurts long-term
- Specificity enables action
- Timely > perfect

### Feedback Formula
```
Observation + Impact + Suggestion = Useful Feedback
```

## Evaluation Framework

### What to Evaluate
| Dimension | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| Values | Are they aligned? Do they act on them? |
| Abilities | Can they think the required way? |
| Skills | Can they do the required tasks? |
| Performance | Are they meeting goals? |
| Growth | Are they improving? |

### How to Evaluate
- Metrics where possible
- 360 feedback
- Specific examples
- Patterns over time

## Testing People

### Probe, Don't Assume
- Ask them to explain their thinking
- Give them challenging tasks
- Observe under pressure
- Check understanding directly

### Stress Testing
- New situations reveal capability
- How do they handle uncertainty?
- Do they ask for help appropriately?
- Can they adapt?

## Sorting: The Hard Part

### Three Outcomes
```
1. Right person, right role → Keep
2. Right person, wrong role → Move
3. Wrong person → Remove
```

### Don't Rehabilitate
- Training can improve skills
- Cannot change values or core abilities
- If fundamental mismatch → transition out

### Tough Love Applies
- Keeping wrong person hurts everyone
- Including them (wrong fit = unhappy)
- Quick, honest transition > lingering

## Guardrails vs Trust

### When Guardrails
- New to role
- Unproven track record
- High-stakes decisions
- Learning phase

### Earning Trust
```
Guardrails → Demonstrate → Trust → Autonomy → Verify
```

### Never Fully Remove Verification
- Trust but verify
- Metrics visibility
- Regular check-ins

## Key Formulas
| Formula | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Constant Feedback = Kindness | Helps growth |
| Train, Don't Hope | Explicit development |
| Don't Rehabilitate | Can't change core |
| Trust but Verify | Always maintain visibility |
