# 5. Believability-Weight Your Decision Making

## Core Formula
```
Believability = Track Record + Logical Reasoning
```

## What is Believability

### Definition
Someone is believable on a topic when they have:
1. **Track Record**: 3+ successful experiences in the relevant field
2. **Logic**: Can explain cause-effect when probed

### Domain-Specific
- Believable in investing ≠ believable in management
- Believable in sales ≠ believable in engineering
- Must assess per topic

## Three Decision Systems

| System | Description | Quality |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Autocracy | Leader decides alone | Poor |
| Democracy | Equal votes | Bad |
| Idea Meritocracy | Believability-weighted | Best |

### Why Not Democracy
- Not all opinions equal
- Uninformed views counted same as expert
- Popular ≠ correct

### Why Not Autocracy
- One person's blind spots
- No error correction
- Limited perspective

### Why Idea Meritocracy
- Best ideas win regardless of source
- Weighted by demonstrated capability
- Self-correcting

## Believability Weighting

### How to Weight
```
Weight = f(track record, logic, domain relevance)
```

### Practical Application
1. Identify decision to make
2. Identify relevant domain
3. Assess each person's believability in that domain
4. Weight opinions accordingly
5. Make decision

### Tools
- Dot Collector: real-time meeting feedback
- Baseball Cards: track person's attributes/believability
- Track records: documented performance history

## Roles Based on Believability

### Student vs Teacher vs Peer
| Your Believability | Their Believability | Your Role |
|--------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Low | High | Student (ask questions) |
| High | Low | Teacher (explain) |
| Equal | Equal | Peer (debate) |

### When to Debate vs Learn
- If much less believable → ask questions, try to understand
- If roughly equal → debate, explore differences
- If much more believable → explain your reasoning clearly

## Finding Believable People Who Disagree

### Why Important
- Confirmation bias risk
- Blind spot exposure
- Stress-test ideas

### How to Find
- Seek out contrarian views
- Ask "who disagrees with this?"
- Create safe space for disagreement

## Overriding the Crowd

### When Acceptable
- You're more believable on THIS topic
- You can articulate why clearly
- You're willing to be accountable
- You document your reasoning

### Dalio's Rule
> "In 40 years, I never overrode the believability-weighted consensus"

## Key Formulas
| Formula | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Believability = Track + Logic | Definition |
| Idea Meritocracy > Democracy | Best system |
| Domain-specific believability | Not universal |
| Disagree + Commit | After decision |
