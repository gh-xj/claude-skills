# 16. Don't Overlook Governance

## Core Principle
```
Checks and balances required at every level
No one above the system
```

## Why Governance Matters

### Without Governance
- Power concentrates
- Blind spots unaddressed
- No error correction
- System vulnerable to individuals

### With Governance
- Accountability maintained
- Perspectives balanced
- Continuity ensured
- System > individuals

## Checks and Balances

### Principle
```
No single point of failure for critical decisions
Verification at appropriate levels
Independent oversight
```

### Implementation
| Level | Check |
|-------|-------|
| Individual | Peer review |
| Team | Manager oversight |
| Department | Cross-functional input |
| Organization | Board oversight |

## Board Oversight

### Board Role
- Oversee CEO/leadership
- Protect organization interest
- Provide outside perspective
- Ensure continuity

### Board ≠ Management
| Board | Management |
|-------|------------|
| Oversight | Operations |
| Strategic direction | Tactical execution |
| Hire/fire CEO | Day-to-day decisions |
| Long-term view | Short/medium-term |

## Clear Decision Rights

### Define Explicitly
```
Who can decide what?
Up to what limit?
What requires escalation?
Who must be consulted?
```

### Decision Matrix
| Decision Type | Authority |
|---------------|-----------|
| Strategic | Board/CEO |
| Operational | Department heads |
| Tactical | Team leads |
| Individual | Contributors |

## Beware Fiefdoms

### Warning Signs
- "That's not my area"
- Information hoarding
- Empire building
- Resistance to oversight

### Prevention
- Cross-functional teams
- Information transparency
- Rotation programs
- Unified metrics

## Succession and Continuity

### Preparation
- Identify successors early
- Develop future leaders
- Document key decisions
- Build institutional knowledge

### No Irreplaceable People
```
If someone is irreplaceable → That's a risk
Plan for transition
Reduce single-person dependencies
```
