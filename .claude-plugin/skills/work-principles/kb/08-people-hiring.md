# 8. Hire Right, Penalties for Wrong Are Huge

## Core Principle
```
Hiring Priority: Values > Abilities > Skills
```

## Why This Order

### Values (Hardest to Change)
- What do they care about?
- What motivates them?
- How do they treat others?
- Can't teach values

### Abilities (Hard to Change)
- How do they think?
- Natural cognitive patterns
- Learning capacity
- Some improvement possible

### Skills (Easier to Change)
- What can they do?
- Learned capabilities
- Can be trained
- Fastest to develop

## Cost of Wrong Hire

### Direct Costs
- Salary during poor performance
- Training investment lost
- Hiring replacement costs
- Severance

### Indirect Costs
- Team morale impact
- Missed opportunities
- Management time spent
- Culture damage

### Rule
> Cost of wrong hire >> Cost of thorough hiring process

## Systematic Hiring

### Process
```
1. Define role clearly
2. Identify required [Values, Abilities, Skills]
3. Source candidates widely
4. Assess systematically
5. Check references thoroughly
6. Make offer to best fit
```

### Assessment Methods
| Method | What It Tests |
|--------|---------------|
| Behavioral interviews | Past patterns |
| Psychometric tests | Abilities, personality |
| Case studies | Problem-solving |
| References | Track record |
| Trial period | Real performance |

## Match Person to Design

### Design First
```
Role requirements → Person selection
NOT
Person available → Role definition
```

### Don't Design Around Weakness
- If role needs X, hire for X
- Don't reshape role to avoid weakness
- Find right person for designed role

## Character + Capabilities

### Both Required
| Character | Capabilities |
|-----------|--------------|
| Integrity | Skills for role |
| Work ethic | Relevant abilities |
| Values alignment | Track record |
| Coachability | Learning capacity |

### Missing Either
- Great capability, bad character → disaster
- Great character, weak capability → wrong role

## Hiring for Culture Fit

### What to Assess
- Alignment with radical truth/transparency
- Comfort with direct feedback
- Growth mindset
- Accountability orientation

### Red Flags
| Red Flag | Risk |
|----------|------|
| Avoids hard questions | Won't be transparent |
| Blames others | Won't be accountable |
| Defensive about feedback | Won't learn |
| Values harmony over truth | Won't speak up |

## Key Formulas
| Formula | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Values > Abilities > Skills | Hiring priority |
| Wrong hire cost >> Hiring cost | Invest in process |
| Design → Person | Not reverse |
| Character + Capability = Required | Both needed |
