# 1. Trust in Radical Truth and Radical Transparency

## Core Formula
```
Idea Meritocracy = Radical Truth + Radical Transparency + Believability-Weighted Decisions
```

## Why Radical Truth

### Nothing to Fear from Truth
- Truth is foundation of good outcomes
- Hiding problems → problems grow
- Surface issues → solve them

### Integrity Required
- Say what you believe
- Act on what you say
- No hidden agendas

### Rights and Obligations
| Right | Obligation |
|-------|------------|
| Understand what's happening | Speak up about problems |
| Access to information | Be honest about mistakes |
| Question decisions | Challenge ideas respectfully |

## Why Radical Transparency

### Default = Open
- Share almost everything
- Record meetings for learning
- Let sunlight disinfect

### Exceptions (Keep Private)
- Personal private information
- Trade secrets (if leak would harm)
- Information that would be harmful if leaked

### Trust Building
```
Transparency + Time = Trust
Pain + Reflection = Progress
```

## Implementation

### Communication Rules
| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Say directly what you think | Be diplomatic at expense of truth |
| Give feedback in real-time | Save criticism for reviews |
| Share reasoning, not just conclusions | Hide your thinking process |
| Acknowledge your uncertainties | Pretend certainty you don't have |

### Creating Safe Space
- Disagree well: calm + curious
- Separate behavior from person
- Focus on improvement, not blame

### 18-Month Transition
- Initially uncomfortable
- Becomes liberating
- Eventually can't imagine working any other way

## Tough Love Principle
```
Caring + Honest = Tough Love
```
- Deny comfort → develop strength
- Direct help constantly → weaken → need more help
- Balance support with challenge

## Key Formulas
| Formula | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| RT + RT = Trust | Truth + Transparency builds trust |
| Default = Open | Share unless specific exception |
| Caring + Honest = Tough Love | Both required |
| 18 months = habit | Transition timeline |
