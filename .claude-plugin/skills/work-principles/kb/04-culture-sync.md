# 4. Get and Stay in Sync

## Core Principle
```
Conflict → Resolution → Stronger Bond
1 + 1 = 3 (when synced)
```

## Why Sync Matters

### Alignment vs Agreement
- Goal is ALIGNMENT, not agreement
- Can disagree on details, align on direction
- Productive disagreement is healthy

### Great Collaboration = Jazz
- Each person contributes unique perspective
- Improvisation within structure
- Listening as important as playing

## Getting in Sync

### Process
```
1. State views clearly → What do you believe and why?
2. Identify disagreement → Where exactly do we differ?
3. Explore reasons → Why do we see it differently?
4. Apply believability → Who is more believable here?
5. Decide and commit → One path forward
```

### Communication Rules
| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Question > statement | Make assertions without data |
| Be curious about differences | Defend your position |
| Seek to understand | Seek to be understood first |
| Acknowledge other's view | Dismiss without consideration |

## Open-Minded vs Closed-Minded

| Open-Minded | Closed-Minded |
|-------------|---------------|
| "How do I know I'm right?" | "I know I'm right" |
| Questions own views | Defends own views |
| Seeks to understand | Seeks to be understood |
| Says "I might be wrong" | Says "I'm right" |
| Genuinely curious | Superficially curious |

## Thoughtful Disagreement

### Requirements
- Two higher-level minds communicating
- Genuine desire to find truth
- Willingness to change mind

### Technique
- Repeat other's view → confirm understanding
- Ask clarifying questions
- Present your view with reasoning
- Explore differences calmly

### Two-Minute Rule
When disagreeing, let other person speak uninterrupted for 2 minutes

## Breaking Deadlocks

### Escalation Path
```
1. Discuss between parties
2. Escalate to more believable party
3. Use agreed-upon principles
4. Get independent arbitration
5. Leader decides + documents reasoning
```

### When to Escalate
- Significant impact
- Genuine impasse
- Time-sensitive decision
- Pattern of conflict

## Staying in Sync

- Focus on future, not past
- Seek understanding first

### Once Decided
```
Decision made → Get behind it
Disagree and commit
No undermining
```
