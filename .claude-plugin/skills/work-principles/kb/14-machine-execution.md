# 14. Do What You Set Out to Do

## Core Principle
```
Plan without execution = Nothing
Connect every task to the goal
```

## Task-Goal Connection

### Always Know Why
```
Task → connects to → Goal
If unclear → Pause → Ask why
```

### Lost Connection Signs
- Doing work without knowing purpose
- Can't explain how task helps goal
- Tasks feeling arbitrary
- Motion without progress

## Everyone Has Too Much to Do

### Reality
- More possible than time allows
- Prioritization is essential
- Saying no is required

### Response Options
```
1. Prioritize (most important first)
2. Delegate (right person for task)
3. Improve (find faster way)
```

### Not an Option
- Doing everything poorly
- Burning out
- Missing critical items

## Prioritization Principles

### Must-Do vs Like-to-Do
```
Must-do first → THEN like-to-do
If no time for like-to-do → OK
If no time for must-do → PROBLEM
```

### Prioritization Framework
| Factor | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Impact | How much does this matter? |
| Urgency | When is it needed? |
| Dependency | What's blocked by this? |
| Effort | How hard is it? |

## Checklists and Systems

### Why Checklists
- Prevent forgetting
- Ensure consistency
- Enable delegation
- Reduce cognitive load

### Good Checklist Qualities
| Quality | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Complete | All steps included |
| Ordered | Right sequence |
| Clear | Unambiguous |
| Tested | Known to work |

## Push Through to Completion

### Completion Culture
- Started → must finish
- No partial credit for almost done
- Close loops

### Obstacles to Completion
| Obstacle | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| New priorities emerge | Renegotiate or complete first |
| Gets hard | Push through |
| Loses interest | Remember why it matters |
| Dependencies blocked | Escalate or find alternative |

## Allow Rest and Recovery

### Sustainable Pace
- Sprints need recovery
- Chronic overwork → decline
- Rest enables performance

### Rest is Productive
- Recharges capacity
- Enables creativity
- Prevents burnout
- Improves decision quality

## Follow-Through Discipline

### Habits That Help
- Daily review of commitments
- Weekly planning
- Regular progress checks
- Visible tracking

### Accountability
- Make commitments public
- Report on status
- Own the outcome
- Ask for help early

## Key Formulas
| Formula | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Task → Goal | Always connected |
| Must-do THEN like-to-do | Priority order |
| Started → Finished | Completion culture |
| Rest = Productive | Sustainability |
