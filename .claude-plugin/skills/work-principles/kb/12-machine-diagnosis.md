# 12. Diagnose Problems to Get at Their Root Causes

## Core Framework
```
Problem → Proximate Cause → Root Cause → Design Fix
```

## Three Key Questions

### 1. Good or Bad Outcome?
- Start with facts
- What actually happened?
- Compared to what was expected?

### 2. Who Was Responsible?
- Not blame, but accountability
- Who was the RP (Responsible Party)?
- Who made the decisions?

### 3. Incapable Person or Bad Design?
| If Person | If Design |
|-----------|-----------|
| Training issue? | Process gap? |
| Wrong role fit? | Missing guardrails? |
| Values mismatch? | Unclear accountability? |
| Should they be here? | System needs change? |

## Proximate vs Root Cause

### Definitions
| Type | Description | Form |
|------|-------------|------|
| Proximate | Immediate trigger | Verb (action/inaction) |
| Root | Underlying reason | Adjective (trait/system) |

### Examples
```
Problem: Missed deadline
Proximate: Didn't start early enough (verb)
Root: Poor planning habits (adjective)

Problem: Customer complaint
Proximate: Shipped wrong product (verb)
Root: Inadequate QA process (adjective - design)
```

## The 5 Whys (Adapted)

### Process
```
Problem: X happened
Why? → Answer 1
Why? → Answer 2
Why? → Answer 3
Why? → Answer 4
Why? → Root Cause (usually 3-5 levels deep)
```

### Stop When
- You reach something fixable at system level
- Further "why" doesn't add insight
- You're at values/abilities level

## Root Cause Categories

| Category | Signal | Example Fix |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| People | Same person, different failures | Role change/exit |
| Design | Same failure, different people | Process redesign |
| Culture | Widespread issue | Principles/values work |
| Tools | Consistent breakdowns | System upgrade |

## Pattern Recognition

### One-Off vs Systemic
| One-Off | Systemic |
|---------|----------|
| Unusual circumstances | Repeating pattern |
| Bad luck | Bad design |
| Address directly | Fix the system |

### Questions
- Is this the first time?
- Similar issues elsewhere?
- What's the pattern?
- Is this a symptom of something larger?

## Diagnosis Meeting Structure

### Preparation
1. Gather facts (not opinions)
2. Identify relevant parties
3. Review related patterns

### During (15-60 min)
```
1. State problem clearly (5 min)
2. Review facts (10 min)
3. Identify proximate causes (10 min)
4. Dig to root causes (15 min)
5. Categorize (people/design/culture/tools) (5 min)
6. Assign next steps (5 min)
```

### Output
- Root cause identified
- Category determined
- Owner for fix assigned
- Timeline set

## Key Formulas
| Formula | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Proximate → Root | Keep digging |
| Person OR Design | Key distinction |
| Pattern → Systemic Fix | Not individual fix |
| 5 Whys = Depth | Diagnosis technique |
