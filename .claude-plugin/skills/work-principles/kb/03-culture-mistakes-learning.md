# 3. Mistakes Okay, Not Learning Unacceptable

## Core Principle
```
Pain + Reflection = Progress
Mistake + No Learning = Unacceptable
```

## Mistake Philosophy

### Mistakes are Inevitable
- Complex work → errors happen
- Innovation requires risk
- No mistakes = not pushing limits

### What Matters
| Acceptable | Unacceptable |
|------------|--------------|
| Making mistakes | Hiding mistakes |
| Trying and failing | Not trying |
| Learning from errors | Repeating same error |
| Admitting weakness | Defending failure |

## Issue Log System

### Purpose
- Mandatory recording of ALL mistakes/problems
- Surface issues systematically
- Track patterns over time
- Address root causes

### Rules
| Rule | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Log it → you're safe | Encourages honesty |
| Don't log → trouble | Accountability |
| All issues, any severity | Complete picture |
| Include who's responsible | Clear ownership |

### Evolution
Started from single trading mistake → became core management tool

## Learning from Mistakes

### Reflection Process
```
Mistake → Pain → Pause → Reflect → Lesson → Principle → Change
```

### Questions to Ask
1. What happened? (facts only)
2. What was the root cause?
3. Is this a pattern or one-off?
4. What's the lesson/principle?
5. What will change?

### Pattern Recognition
| Pattern Type | Response |
|--------------|----------|
| Same person, different errors | Role fit issue |
| Same error, different people | Process/design issue |
| Widespread issue | Culture issue |

## Blame vs Accountability

### Difference
| Blame | Accountability |
|-------|----------------|
| Who to punish | Who to improve |
| Past-focused | Future-focused |
| Creates hiding | Creates openness |
| Emotional | Analytical |

### Goal
Accurate accountability → targeted improvement

## Creating Safe Environment

### Psychological Safety
- OK to admit "I don't know"
- OK to ask for help
- OK to challenge anyone's idea
- OK to say "I was wrong"

### Not OK
- Hiding problems
- Blaming others
- Defending bad decisions
- Repeating same mistakes

## Key Formulas
| Formula | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Pain + Reflection = Progress | Core equation |
| Log it = Safe | Issue log principle |
