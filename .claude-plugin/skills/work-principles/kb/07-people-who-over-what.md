# 7. WHO Is More Important Than WHAT

## Core Principle
```
Right People > Right Strategy
WHO > WHAT
```

## Why WHO First

### Reasoning
- Strategy changes, people execute
- Great people adapt to challenges
- Wrong people fail even with right plan
- People determine culture

### The Most Important Decision
Choosing the right Responsible Party (RP)

## Responsible Party (RP)

### Definition
The person who bears the consequences of the outcome

### RP Characteristics
| Must Have | Must Do |
|-----------|---------|
| Authority to decide | Own the outcome |
| Resources to execute | Be accountable |
| Capability for the task | Drive to completion |

### Ultimate RP
- Bears full consequences
- Has final authority
- Cannot delegate accountability (only tasks)

## Remember the Force Behind the Thing

### Principle
Look at WHO did it, not just WHAT was done

### Why
- Same strategy, different people → different results
- Success/failure traces to people
- Patterns in people reveal capability

### Example
```
Project failed
   ↓
What: Wrong approach?
   ↓
WHO: Wrong person in charge?
   ↓
Root: Usually WHO issue
```

## Matching People to Roles

### The Fit
```
Person's [Values + Abilities + Skills] ↔ Role's [Requirements]
```

### Mismatch Signs
| Sign | Indicates |
|------|-----------|
| Constant struggle | Wrong fit |
| Repeated same mistakes | Capability gap |
| Low motivation | Values mismatch |
| Underperformance | Wrong role |

## People Patterns

### Track Records Matter
- Past behavior predicts future behavior
- Look for patterns across situations
- One data point ≠ pattern

### What to Track
- What situations do they handle well?
- Where do they struggle?
- How do they respond to feedback?
- Do they learn and improve?

## Building People Inventory

### Know Your People
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Values and motivations
- Best role fit
- Development areas

### Tools
- Baseball Cards (attributes)
- Dot Collector (meeting feedback)
- Performance tracking
- 360 reviews

## Key Formulas
| Formula | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| WHO > WHAT | People over strategy |
| RP = Full Accountability | Can't delegate |
| Pattern > Single Event | Track records |
| Fit = Values + Abilities + Skills | Matching |
