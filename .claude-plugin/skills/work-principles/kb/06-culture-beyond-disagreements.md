# 6. Know How to Get Beyond Disagreements

## Core Principle
```
Disagreement → Resolution Process → Decision → Commit
```

## Resolution Paths

### Standard Path
```
1. Discuss between parties
2. Apply believability weights
3. If impasse → escalate to arbitrator
4. Decision maker decides
5. Everyone commits
```

### Escalation Rules
| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Both believable, disagree | Get third party |
| One clearly more believable | Defer to them |
| Time pressure | Decision maker decides |
| Values question | Principles/leadership |

## Once Decided, Commit

### The Rule
```
Decision made → Get behind it 100%
No undermining
No "I told you so" (if fails)
```

### Why Important
- Execution requires unity
- Second-guessing kills momentum
- Learn from outcomes, not arguments

### What Commit Means
| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Support publicly | Complain to others |
| Execute fully | Half-effort |
| Give honest feedback | Sabotage |
| Learn from outcome | Say "I was right" |

## Handling Persistent Disagreement

### Two Options
1. **Stay and commit**: Genuinely support the decision
2. **Leave**: If can't commit, may need to exit

### Not an Option
- Stay and undermine
- Passive resistance
- Building faction against decision

## Martial Law (Extreme Cases)

### When to Use
- Crisis requiring immediate action
- Normal process too slow
- Temporary override only

### Rules
- Time-limited
- Communicate why
- Return to normal ASAP
- Review afterwards

## Principles as Arbitrator

### Using Principles
- When in doubt → what do principles say?
- Principles > personal preference
- Document how principles apply

### Creating Precedent
- Similar situations → similar treatment
- Build case law over time
- Update principles when needed

## Preventing Future Conflicts

### Root Cause Analysis
After conflict resolution:
1. What caused the disagreement?
2. Is this a pattern?
3. What can prevent recurrence?
4. Do we need a new principle?

### Common Patterns
| Pattern | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Role ambiguity | Clarify responsibilities |
| Different values | Align on principles |
| Poor communication | Improve sync process |
| Repeated same conflict | Create explicit rule |

## Key Formulas
| Formula | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Disagree → Resolve → Commit | Full cycle |
| Stay + Commit OR Leave | Only options |
| Principles > Preferences | Arbitration |
| Pattern → Principle | Prevention |
