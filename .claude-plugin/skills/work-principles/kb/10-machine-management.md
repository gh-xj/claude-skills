# 10. Manage as Someone Operating a Machine to Achieve a Goal

## Core Principle
```
Organization = Machine → Outcomes
Manager = Engineer who designs and maintains the machine
```

## Machine Thinking

### The View
```
Look DOWN on the machine from higher level
        ↓
[Culture + People] → [Processes] → [Outcomes]
        ↓
Compare outcomes vs goals
        ↓
Diagnose gaps
        ↓
Modify machine
```

### Manager as Engineer
| Not | But |
|-----|-----|
| Doing the work | Designing system that does work |
| Firefighting | Preventing fires |
| Individual contributor | System optimizer |
| Heroic savior | Machine builder |

## Two Purposes of Management

### 1. Achieve Goals
- Produce required outcomes
- Meet targets
- Deliver results

### 2. Train the Machine
- Develop people
- Improve processes
- Build capability for future

### Both Required
```
Only #1 → Short-term success, long-term failure
Only #2 → Never delivers
Both → Sustainable excellence
```

## Great Metrics

### Why Metrics
- Can't manage what you can't measure
- Objectivity over opinion
- Early warning system
- Accountability enabler

### Metric Qualities
| Good Metric | Bad Metric |
|-------------|------------|
| Leading indicator | Lagging only |
| Actionable | Interesting but useless |
| Hard to game | Easy to manipulate |
| Connected to goals | Vanity metric |

### Dashboard Approach
```
Key metrics → Visible → Reviewed regularly → Action when off-track
```

## Comparing Outcomes to Goals

### The Loop
```
Goal → Action → Outcome → Compare → Diagnose → Adjust → Repeat
```

### When Outcomes ≠ Goals
1. Is the goal wrong?
2. Is the design wrong?
3. Are the people wrong?
4. Is execution wrong?

## Organizational Engineering

### Design Principles
1. Design BEFORE people
2. Clear accountability
3. Pyramid structure (clear reporting)
4. Metrics everywhere
5. Guardrails > blind trust

### Accountability Pattern
```
Goal → Responsible Party → Metrics → Review → Adjust
```

## Common Management Failures

| Failure | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Micromanaging | Don't trust machine | Build better machine |
| Ignoring problems | Avoid conflict | Radical transparency |
| Doing work yourself | Can't delegate | Train/hire properly |
| No metrics | Flying blind | Instrument the machine |

## Key Formulas
| Formula | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Manager = Engineer | Design, don't do |
| Achieve + Train = Management | Both purposes |
| Metrics = Visibility | Can't manage without |
| Outcome ≠ Goal → Diagnose | Systematic response |
