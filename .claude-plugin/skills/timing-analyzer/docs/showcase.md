# Time Intelligence

Turn passive time tracking into active self-knowledge.

## The Problem

You track your time. But do you *know* your time?

- Where did last year go?
- What books did you actually finish?
- When did you stop growing?

## The Solution

Natural language queries against your Timing.app data.

```
"show my growth time for the past year"
"what media did I consume today?"
"break down my work by project"
```

## What You Get

### Daily Report (10 seconds)

```
Category   Subcategory   Time   %
────────────────────────────────────────
Work       Project A     4h30m  45.0%  █████████████
Growth     Reading       2h15m  22.5%  ██████
Health     Exercise      1h00m  10.0%  ███
```

### Yearly Analysis

Not just totals — meaningful breakdowns:

| Activity | Hours |
|----------|-------|
| Deep work | 420h |
| Learning | 180h |
| Meetings | 95h |

### Content Discovery

Not just *how long* — but **what exactly**:

```
Book: [Title]           12.5h
Course: [Topic]          8.0h
Project: [Name]         45.0h
```

### Pattern Detection

> "Your deep work peaked in Q1 (155 hours).
> Since Q3, it dropped 60%. What changed?"

## What Makes This Different

| Traditional | This |
|-------------|------|
| "You used apps for 8 hours" | "You read [Book] for 8 hours" |
| "Weekly summary: 40h tracked" | "Your learning dropped 60% since Q3" |
| Pie charts | Actionable insights |
| Export to CSV | Ask in plain English |

## One Question That Changes Everything

> "What did I actually spend my time on last year?"

Now you can answer it.
